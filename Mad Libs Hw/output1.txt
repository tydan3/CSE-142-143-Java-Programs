Once upon a time there was a princess. This princess was the
most yellow in all the lands. The princess lived in a
ugly castle made of feet . She spent most of
her time watching the wheels play and learning how to
be a/an heavy princess. She had a dragon named George . The dragon
kept the princess safe by scaring off any bills that might
approach her. This made the princess feel anxious with the dragon.
One day, when the dragon was off-duty, a witch came to the castle.
The witch gave the princess a poisoned bird and told the princess
to eat it. The observant princess realized this was a trick and chased
the witch off with her trusty superman , given to her by her dwarf friends.
The princess lived recklessly ever after.
