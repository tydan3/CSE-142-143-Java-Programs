Once upon a time there was a princess. This princess was the
most hungry in all the lands. The princess lived in a
angry castle made of eggs . She spent most of
her time watching the cars play and learning how to
be a/an pasty princess. She had a dragon named George . The dragon
kept the princess safe by scaring off any people that might
approach her. This made the princess feel nostalgic with the dragon.
One day, when the dragon was off-duty, a witch came to the castle.
The witch gave the princess a poisoned wrench and told the princess
to eat it. The observant princess realized this was a trick and chased
the witch off with her trusty oil , given to her by her dwarf friends.
The princess lived sadly ever after.
