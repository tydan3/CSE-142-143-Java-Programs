Once upon a time there was a princess. This princess was the
most cool in all the lands. The princess lived in a
sexy castle made of kicks . She spent most of
her time watching the daniel play and learning how to
be a/an ugly princess. She had a dragon named daniel . The dragon
kept the princess safe by scaring off any slaves that might
approach her. This made the princess feel love with the dragon.
One day, when the dragon was off-duty, a witch came to the castle.
The witch gave the princess a poisoned tacoma and told the princess
to eat it. The observant princess realized this was a trick and chased
the witch off with her trusty danielclone , given to her by her dwarf friends.
The princess lived sweatily ever after.
