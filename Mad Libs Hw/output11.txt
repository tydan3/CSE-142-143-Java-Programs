Once upon a time there was a princess. This princess was the
most happy in all the lands. The princess lived in a
sad castle made of cats . She spent most of
her time watching the dogs play and learning how to
be a/an long princess. She had a dragon named john . The dragon
kept the princess safe by scaring off any bottles that might
approach her. This made the princess feel very angry with the dragon.
One day, when the dragon was off-duty, a witch came to the castle.
The witch gave the princess a poisoned lanyard , and told the princess
to eat it. The observant princess realized this was a trick and chased
the witch off with her trusty mouse , given to her by her dwarf friends.
The princess lived happily ever after.
