Once upon a time there was a princess. This princess was the
most bright in all the lands. The princess lived in a
tiny castle made of kittens . She spent most of
her time watching the darts play and learning how to
be a/an plain princess. She had a dragon named CD . The dragon
kept the princess safe by scaring off any nuts that might
approach her. This made the princess feel special with the dragon.
One day, when the dragon was off-duty, a witch came to the castle.
The witch gave the princess a poisoned PC and told the princess
to eat it. The observant princess realized this was a trick and chased
the witch off with her trusty hammer , given to her by her dwarf friends.
The princess lived retardly ever after.
